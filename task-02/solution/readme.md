Terminal Hunt was fun and easy task for me.

Commands used:
. cd- To change the directory

. mkdir- To make directory

. ls- To list the contents

. cat (filename)- To view, input and enter data in a file.

. git log 

. git branch -a

. git checkout origin/asia

. cat part1.txt part2.txt part3.txt part4.txt > password.txt

Git terminal commands:

git add . -to add all the changes or to add all modified files in the current directory.

git status - it shows the state of current directory.
 
git commit -m update - it commit all the changes made to the main branches.

git push - it upload the local repo to remote repo.
